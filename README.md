# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## 1. Simple linear Regression



## 2. Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python. The dataset used is the **50 Startups Dataset**, which helps predict the profit of startups based on their R&D Spend, Administration costs, Marketing Spend, and the state in which they operate.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Explore the relationship between startup expenses and profits.
2. Build a **Multiple Linear Regression Model** to predict startup profit.
3. Use **Backward Elimination** for feature selection to create an optimized model.

### Dataset
The dataset `50_Startups.csv` contains the following columns:
- **R&D Spend**: Money spent on research and development.
- **Administration**: Money spent on administration.
- **Marketing Spend**: Money spent on marketing.
- **State**: The state in which the startup operates.
- **Profit**: The profit of the startup (target variable).
